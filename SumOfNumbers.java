/**
 * Write a program to calculate the sum for a series of numbers 1, â€¦, n where n is user input. 
 * Example: For input of 5 the sum is: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
 * 
 * Main Exercise:
 * Create a new console project 
 * Add the code to the main method. Use whichever loop you find appropriate.
 * 
 * Extension:
 * Let the user enter two numbers and add the numbers from one to the other. 
 * Example: For input 2 and 5 the sum is: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14.
 * Add a check if the second number is bigger than the first one.
